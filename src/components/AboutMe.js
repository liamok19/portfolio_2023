        Aloha, I'm Liam, Li, Leeham and my list of nicknames continues to grow.
        I'm a Full Stack Developer with extensive experience with server side
        and client side applications.I attended the University of Sydney and
        Trinity College Education and completed a certificate in Full Stack Web
        Development. I have a creative flare and I owe that to working in the
        VFX and Animation Industry for over 8 years. From this I have a wealth
        of experience managing productions involving Artists, Directors, Admin,
        Production, and Marketing team members. During the Full Stack Web
        Development course I learnt best practices for designing powerful
        mobile-friendly websites and applications.

        A fabulous thing about me is that I have traded dancing on stage for
        dancing in the kitchen. Despite the fact that it has no relevance to
        programming, it contributes to the upbeat nature I bring to the working
        environment.
